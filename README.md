### Description 
A 2D action mini game given the theme **2 Dimensions**
The goal of the game is to surive and kill as many monsters as possible.

### Technologies Used
Unity - Game Engine

Aseprite - Pixel Art Editor

### Challenges Faced
Time management - I was unable to work on the project for multiple days of the game jam due to life and other factors. Hence, I struggled to polish the game on how I would like and failed to satisfy the theme of the gamejam.
